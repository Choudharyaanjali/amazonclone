The Amazon Clone project is a web development endeavor aimed at replicating the renowned e-commerce platform's user interface using HTML and CSS. This project serves as an exercise in front-end web development, focusing on the visual elements and layout design of the Amazon website.

Using HTML, the project establishes the structure of the web pages, including headers, footers, navigation bars, product listings, and checkout pages. CSS is employed extensively to style and customize the appearance of each element, ensuring it closely resembles the original Amazon website.
